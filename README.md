# Freestyle Setup Helper

## Product Questions

This will help me understand better the requirements for the application. This answers will also serve as an initial point to inform the user how to use the application.

- What should I look out for when choosing deck/trucks/wheels for freestyle?
- What are the advantages/disadvantages of having narrower/flush/wider wheels+trucks?
    - What are the ideal offsets for narrower/wider wheels+trucks?

## Implementation Questions

- Are there different type of offset wheels? How are they different?
- What is the wheel+truck formula for centered wheels?
    - Any other formula we should consider besides sideset and centered wheels?
- What is the width of a washer? Are they standardized?
- Is the width from end of bearing to end of bearing standard? What is the most common width?
- Do we need to consider squashed nuts?

## Roadmap

- Add support for washers.
- Add formula for centered wheels.
- Show more useful information on the result.
  - Current offset and what it would be good for.
  - Diagram showing current measurements and how they affect the setup.
- Add educational information to help understand how to use the application.
- Add a "Desired Offset" option after the user chooses two setup elements. This would filter the options on the remaining element to match the desired offset.
  - We could also use this to suggest how many washers you'll need.
- Add more data points (decks, trucks, wheels).
